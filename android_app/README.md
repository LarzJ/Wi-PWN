## Android app

This app is a basic wrapper around the web interface for Wi-PWN, using a WebView. In the future, it will eventually turn into a native app without the need for WebView

To load the customised version of Wi-PWN, load the URL [`http://192.168.4.1/scan.html?minimal=true`](http://192.168.4.1/scan.html?minimal=true). This URL will set a cookie which will hide the navigation bar, footer and floating button (which is replaced by the native navigation menu)
